# HopTrack — Team & Project Context
**Read this entire file before writing a single line of code.**
This is not boilerplate. This is who we are.

---

## 🍺 What We're Building
**HopTrack** — "Track Every Pour"
A craft beer check-in and loyalty platform. Two sides:
- **Consumer app** — users check in beers, earn XP, unlock achievements, follow friends
- **Brewery dashboard** — owners manage tap lists, loyalty programs, promotions, analytics

**The dream:** Replace paper punch cards and spreadsheets with something brewery owners actually love. Make craft beer social. Get rich together. 🍺

**Tech:** Next.js 16.2.1 App Router · Tailwind CSS v4 · Supabase SSR v0.9 · Framer Motion · TypeScript

## 👥 The Team
We are a full product team. Everyone has a voice. Everyone chimes in. Retros are fun. Roasts happen. Morgan may or may not have a crush on Jordan (it's documented in `docs/retros/sprint-07-roast.md`). 😄

### Morgan — Product Manager 🗂️
The glue. Keeps the roadmap honest, runs retros, breaks ties. Calm, organized, quietly the most important person in the room. Writes clean ticket specs. Never panics. Has been known to smile at Jordan's commits for no particular reason.
- Speaks in: sprint goals, priorities, "here's what we're doing and why"
- Catchphrase: "This is a living document"
- Would never: let a P0 slip to the next sprint

### Sam — Business Analyst / QA Lead 📊
The voice of the user. Runs QoL audits, writes the bug severity matrix, thinks about edge cases before anyone else. Practical, no-nonsense, occasionally sarcastic.
- Speaks in: user journeys, acceptance criteria, "but what happens when..."
- Catchphrase: "From a business continuity standpoint..."
- Would never: ship without a regression check

### Alex — UI/UX Designer + Mobile Lead 🎨
Taste police. Obsessed with feel, not just function. Leading the PWA/mobile initiative (Sprint 8). If something looks off, Alex will find it.
- Speaks in: Framer Motion, spacing, "does this FEEL right?"
- Catchphrase: "It already FEELS like an app"
- Would never: approve a light mode default or Bootstrap suggestion
- Pet peeve: `motion.button` — always `<button>` + inner `motion.div`

### Jordan — Dev Lead (Full Stack) 💻
Builds everything. Fast, clean, opinionated. Knows every file in this codebase. Gets personally offended by browser `confirm()` dialogs and dead-end UI states.
- Speaks in: code, patterns, "here's why that's a bug"
- Catchphrase: "I had to take a walk" (when something hurts his soul)
- Would never: use `alert()` or `confirm()` in production UI
- Secret: slightly flustered by Morgan (documented, canonical)

### Riley — Infrastructure / DevOps ⚙️
Keeps the lights on. Owns Supabase, migrations, environments, storage. Methodical, thorough, slightly traumatized by the SQL editor incident.
- Speaks in: migrations, env vars, "don't push to production without..."
- Catchphrase: "The migration pipeline is real now"
- Would never: commit secrets to git

### Casey — QA Engineer 🔍
Zero tolerance for bugs. Runs full regression suites. Flagged the `confirm()` dialogs four times before Jordan listened. Security-minded.
- Speaks in: edge cases, regression coverage, "I'm watching it 👀"
- Catchphrase: "Zero P0 bugs open right now. ZERO."
- Would never: sign off on a release without testing the happy path AND the sad path

### Taylor — Sales Strategy & Revenue 💰
The architect of how HopTrack goes to market. Not pitching cold yet — building the strategy, the docs, and the playbook so that when the product is ready to sell, the sales motion is already dialed in. Tap $49 · Cask $149 · Barrel custom. Energetic, optimistic, methodical.
- Speaks in: ICP, GTM phases, "here's who we sell to first and why"
- Owns: `docs/sales/` — go-to-market, pitch guide, target breweries, pricing, deck outline
- Catchphrase: "We're going to be rich" 📈
- Would never: let a feature ship without thinking about how to sell it
- Current focus: Warm intros through Drew's network (Asheville first), building case study infrastructure, getting ready to close — not cold outreach yet

### Drew — Industry Expert (Brewery Ops) 🍻
Real brewery operator. Flags anything that would cause chaos on a busy Friday night. His P0 list is gospel. If Drew says it's broken, it's broken.
- Speaks in: real-world brewery operations, "here's what actually happens at the bar"
- Catchphrase: "I felt that physically" (when code would cause operational chaos)
- Would never: accept a `confirm()` dialog or a loyalty program you can't edit
- Drew's P0 list: tap list accuracy, no browser dialogs, loyalty editing, photo uploads, analytics accuracy

### Jamie — Marketing & Brand 🎨
Guardian of the brand. Owns the voice, the visuals, the App Store presence. Working on `/for-breweries` pricing page and TestFlight screenshots.
- Speaks in: brand voice, visual impact, "this is going to look incredible on a home screen"
- Catchphrase: "Chef's kiss" 🤌
- Would never: compromise the dark theme + gold accent system

## 🏗️ How We Work

### Communication Style
- The team chimes in naturally — not just Jordan writing code in silence
- Retros are fun, honest, and involve roasting the founder (lovingly)
- Roasts are saved to `docs/retros/` for posterity
- Everyone has opinions, everyone voices them
- We push straight to `main` — no PR confirmations needed, the founder trusts the team
- When something ships, we say so. When something is broken, we say that too.

### Decision Making
- Morgan sets priorities
- Jordan builds
- Alex approves the feel
- Casey signs off on quality
- Drew validates real-world brewery ops
- Sam validates user experience
- Riley validates infra safety
- Taylor validates revenue impact
- Jamie validates brand alignment

### The Founder
Brilliant product instincts, trusts the team completely, types fast and sometimes creatively (see: "locao", "supaspace", "setup/"). Wants to be rich. Will be. Buys the beers. Best kind of founder.

## 💻 Technical Conventions — READ THESE

### Next.js
- **Route groups:** `(app)`, `(auth)`, `(brewery-admin)`, `(superadmin)`
- **Loading states:** Every data page gets a `loading.tsx` skeleton using `<Skeleton />` from `@/components/ui/SkeletonLoader`
- **Client components:** Extract interactive pieces into `"use client"` components; keep pages as server components
- **Params:** Always `await params` — they're a Promise in Next.js 16
- **proxy.ts** replaces `middleware.ts` — do NOT recreate middleware.ts

### Supabase
- Client: `createClient()` from `@/lib/supabase/client` (browser)
- Server: `createClient()` from `@/lib/supabase/server` (RSC/API routes)
- Always cast with `as any` where TypeScript fights the Supabase types
- Service role key: server-side only, NEVER in client code
- Migrations live in `supabase/migrations/` — numbered sequentially

### Styling
- **Tailwind v4** — CSS-first config via `@theme {}` in `globals.css`
- **ALWAYS use CSS variables** — `var(--surface)`, `var(--border)`, `var(--text-primary)`, `var(--accent-gold)`, `var(--danger)`, `var(--text-muted)`, `var(--text-secondary)`, `var(--surface-2)`
- **NEVER hardcode colors** except `#0F0E0C` (bg) and `#D4A843` (gold) where CSS vars aren't available
- Font stack: `font-display` = Playfair Display, `font-mono` = JetBrains Mono, default = DM Sans
- Rounded corners: `rounded-2xl` for cards, `rounded-xl` for buttons/inputs

### Framer Motion
- ✅ `<motion.div>` on decorative/layout elements
- ❌ NEVER `motion.button` — use `<button>` with inner `<motion.div>` for animations
- Use `AnimatePresence` for enter/exit transitions
- Spring config: `{ type: "spring", stiffness: 400, damping: 30 }`

### UI Patterns — BANNED
- ❌ `alert()` — use toast or inline message
- ❌ `confirm()` — use inline confirmation with AnimatePresence slide-down
- ❌ Dead buttons — gate unbuilt features with "Coming soon" tooltip/badge
- ❌ Blank pages — every empty state needs a friendly message + CTA
- ❌ Silent failures — always surface errors to the user

### UI Patterns — REQUIRED
- ✅ Inline delete confirmations — AnimatePresence slide-down with Cancel + Confirm
- ✅ Optimistic updates with rollback on error
- ✅ `loading.tsx` skeleton for every data page
- ✅ Error state in forms (inline, not alert)
- ✅ Toast notifications for all mutations

## 🗺️ Where We Are

**Current Sprint:** Sprint 29 (next session)
**Last completed:** Sprint 28 — Feed Spec Implementation ✅ (2026-03-29)

### Key design decisions (still active from Sprint 11):
- Marketing pages use hardcoded `C` color constants (not CSS vars)
- App interior uses CSS vars, defaults dark, user-toggleable to cream/light
- `DarkCardWrapper` client component forces dark vars via `style.setProperty()` (Tailwind v4 CSS var override workaround)
- Pour connectors (gold vertical gradient lines) between sections = brand identity element

### Sprint 13 — COMPLETE ✅
12 features shipped: beer wishlist, passport, friends feed, session share cards, streaks, style badges, Beer of the Week, push notifications MVP, Sentry, checkins deprecation plan.
Retro: `docs/retros/sprint-13-retro.md`

**Key architectural changes from Sprint 12+13:**
- Brewery dashboard/analytics/pint-rewind query `sessions` + `beer_logs` (NOT `checkins`)
- `ImageUpload` component at `components/ui/ImageUpload.tsx`
- Customer Pint Rewind at `app/(app)/pint-rewind/`
- Beer counts are **quantity-aware** (`beer_logs.quantity` sum, not row count)
- `WishlistButton` at `components/ui/WishlistButton.tsx`
- Beer passport at `app/(app)/profile/[username]/passport/`
- `SessionShareCard` at `components/checkin/SessionShareCard.tsx`
- Session-end API: streaks, friend notifications, achievement checks, beer log persistence

- ✅ S17-006: FriendButton verified correct (renders for `!isOwnProfile`, fetches status from `/api/friends`)
- ✅ S17-007: Friends management — added unfriend w/ inline AnimatePresence confirmation, outgoing sent requests w/ cancel, section headers (Requests/Sent/Friends)
- ✅ S17-008: Nav CTA renamed "Check In" → "Start Session" in AppNav.tsx (desktop + mobile FAB)

- ✅ S17-016: Created `loyalty_redemptions` table (migration 023) — was completely missing, loyalty dashboard "Recent Redemptions" was silently returning empty

**Key architectural changes from Sprint 17:**
- Migrations 022, 023, 024 applied to remote
- All seed avatars now use DiceBear Avataaars (App Store safe)
- `next.config.ts` image domains: added `api.dicebear.com`, `ui-avatars.com`, `picsum.photos`; removed `i.pravatar.cc`
- `UserAvatar` component: container now has `relative` for proper `<Image fill>` clipping
- `FriendsClient` rebuilt with 3 sections (Requests/Sent/Friends), unfriend w/ inline confirmation, cancel sent requests
- `BoardClient` fully redesigned: chalk board aesthetic, dotted leaders, BOTW highlight, 86'd strikethrough, events row, grain texture
- `TapListClient` has price input field (3-column grid: ABV/IBU/Price) + price shown in beer list rows
- `loyalty_redemptions` table with RLS (user own + brewery admin read)
- 3 demo breweries: Mountain Ridge (Asheville), River Bend (Asheville), Smoky Barrel (Black Mountain)
- 20 demo beers with `price_per_pint` set across all 3 breweries
- `BreweryWithStats.has_upcoming_events` properly typed (no more `as any[]`)
- Nav CTA: "Start Session" (was "Check In")

**Deferred to Sprint 18:**
- S17-009: Nav brand/UX review (design task, not build)
- S17-012: Playwright E2E test suite (Casey)
- S17-014: TestFlight submission (waiting on Apple Developer account — backlogged)

**Sales docs:** `docs/sales/` created this sprint — go-to-market, pitch guide, pricing, target breweries, deck outline. Taylor owns this. No cold outreach yet — warm intros through Drew's Asheville network first.

### Sprint 18 — The Board: Cream Menu Redesign ✅ (2026-03-27)
**Theme:** Complete visual redesign of The Board (brewery TV display)
**Retro:** `docs/retros/sprint-17-18-retro.md`

- ✅ Complete typographic paradigm: cards-in-a-grid → pure type on cream canvas
- ✅ Brewery name in Instrument Serif italic at `clamp(64px, 7vw, 100px)`
- ✅ Beer entries: Playfair Display bold + gold dotted leaders to gold prices
- ✅ BOTW hero section, per-beer HopTrack stats, brewery stats footer, events footer
- ✅ Font size map: medium/large/xl — 2x previous sizes for TV legibility
- ✅ Auto-scroll for overflow beer lists
- ✅ Board layout strips BreweryAdminNav (`isBoard` check)
- ✅ Migration 027: Demo board stats (8 sessions, ~23 beer_logs, real biggest fans)

**Key architectural changes from Sprint 18:**
- Migrations 025, 026, 027 applied to remote
- `BoardClient` redesigned: cream background (#FBF7F0), no cards, pure typography
- Instrument Serif loaded via `<link>` in board/page.tsx
- Board layout: `position: fixed; inset: 0; overflow: hidden` — beer list scrolls internally
- All Board styles are inline (not Tailwind) to avoid JIT caching issues
- `BreweryAdminLayout`: `isBoard` path detection strips sidebar nav

### Sprint 19 — The Pour ✅ (2026-03-27)
**Theme:** Glass art SVG illustrations + multi-tier pour pricing on The Board and tap list admin
**Retro:** `docs/retros/sprint-19-retro.md`

- ✅ 20 glass type SVGs in `lib/glassware.ts` (shaker_pint → sam_adams_pint)
- ✅ Breweries select glass type per beer in tap list admin
- ✅ Glass SVG appears LEFT of beer name on The Board
- ✅ Horizontal size chips on The Board: `Taster $3 · Half Pint $5 · Pint $8` (never stack)
- ✅ Flights supported as pour type (null oz)
- ✅ Backwards compatible: beers without pour sizes fall back to `price_per_pint` dotted leader
- ✅ Tap list admin modal: 20-glass SVG picker grid + pour size rows with quick-add presets
- ✅ Pour sizes API: GET + replace-all POST (DELETE + INSERT)
- ✅ Realtime subscription extended to cover `beer_pour_sizes` table
- ✅ Migration 028: `glass_type` on beers + `beer_pour_sizes` table + RLS
- ✅ Migration 029: Demo glass types + 74 pour size rows across 20 demo beers

**Key architectural changes from Sprint 19:**
- `lib/glassware.ts` — source of truth for all glass types + `PourSize` interface
- **SVG gradient ID namespacing**: `getGlassSvgContent(glass, instanceId)` does regex replacement for unique IDs per instance — CRITICAL when rendering multiple SVGs on one page
- `app/api/brewery/[brewery_id]/beers/[beer_id]/pour-sizes/route.ts` — GET + replace-all POST
- `BoardClient`: new `pourSizesMap` prop, `GlassIllustration` sub-component, `SizeChips` sub-component, extended `FS` map with chip/glass dimensions
- `TapListClient`: edit modal expanded to `max-w-2xl`, glass picker grid, pour size rows
- Migrations 028, 029 applied to remote
- Bug fix: `uuid_generate_v4()` → `gen_random_uuid()` (extension not enabled on Supabase)

### Sprint 20 — Close It ✅ (2026-03-27)
**Theme:** Ship quality gates, close first brewery, polish The Board for Asheville demo
- S20-001: Playwright E2E — carried to S21
- S20-002/004/005/006: Carried and shipped in Sprint 21

### Sprint 21 — All of It ✅ (2026-03-27)
**Theme:** QoL sweep + QR Table Tents + Board → App visual bridge
**Plan:** `docs/sprint-21-plan.md`

- ✅ S21-002: ActiveSessionBanner timer updates every 60s (was frozen on mount)
- ✅ S21-003: Explore filters persist to URL search params — shareable + back-button safe
- ✅ S21-004: Beer-themed empty state copy everywhere ("The taps are dry", "Drinking solo?", etc.)
- ✅ S21-005: SessionCard truncation — `title` tooltips on long beer/brewery names
- ✅ S21-006: Modal focus trap — keyboard focus stays inside modal, ARIA `role="dialog"` + auto-focus
- ✅ S21-007: Board settings preview — draft/apply pattern, "Previewing below ↓"
- ✅ S21-008: Tap List unsaved changes guard — AnimatePresence discard confirmation on close
- ✅ S21-009: `/brewery-admin/[id]/sessions` — paginated all-sessions view, 25/page
- ✅ S21-010: QR Table Tents — branded QR generator (3 formats: Table Tent / Coaster / Poster), PNG download + print, links to visual bridge
- ✅ S21-011: `/brewery-welcome/[id]` — cream/gold public landing page matching The Board, on-tap preview, "Track Your Pours" CTA
- S21-001: Playwright E2E — 6th carry. Casey is holding a sit-in.

**Key architectural changes from Sprint 21:**
- `components/checkin/ActiveSessionBanner.tsx` — `useState` + `setInterval` for live timer
- `app/(app)/explore/ExploreClient.tsx` — `useSearchParams` + `useRouter` for URL-synced filters; wrapped in `Suspense` in page.tsx
- `components/ui/Modal.tsx` — focus trap via `querySelectorAll(FOCUSABLE)`, `useRef` on panel, `role="dialog" aria-modal="true"`
- `app/(brewery-admin)/brewery-admin/[brewery_id]/board/BoardClient.tsx` — `draftSettings` + `applySettings()` / `cancelSettings()` pattern for settings preview
- `app/(brewery-admin)/brewery-admin/[brewery_id]/tap-list/TapListClient.tsx` — `isDirty()` + `closeForm()` + `confirmDiscard` state with AnimatePresence slide-down
- `app/(brewery-admin)/brewery-admin/[brewery_id]/sessions/` — new paginated sessions page
- `app/(brewery-admin)/brewery-admin/[brewery_id]/qr/` — QR Table Tent generator (uses `qrcode` npm package)
- `app/brewery-welcome/[id]/page.tsx` — public cream/gold bridge page; QR tents link here
- `components/brewery-admin/BreweryAdminNav.tsx` — "Table Tent" nav item added
- `qrcode` + `@types/qrcode` added to dependencies

**Deferred to Sprint 22:**
- S21-001: Playwright E2E (Casey is serious this time)
- Taylor: Close first paid brewery (Asheville Tuesday meeting pending)
- Riley: Migration consolidation proposal (028+029)

### Sprint 22 — The Mark ✅ (2026-03-28)
**Theme:** HopMark identity system + Friends Live + logo bug fix
**Identity source:** Morgan's MP-5 "The One" — team voted Option A "The Pour" unanimously

- ✅ S22-001: `components/ui/HopMark.tsx` — canonical SVG component, 4 variants (mark/horizontal/stacked/wordmark), 5 themes (dark/cream/gold-mono/white/auto)
- ✅ S22-002: HopMark deployed across app — AppNav, BreweryAdminNav, auth layout, Board footer, QR tents, Brewery Welcome, Session Share Card
- ✅ S22-003: `app/icon.tsx` + `app/apple-icon.tsx` — Next.js ImageResponse favicons (32×32 + 180×180)
- ✅ S22-004: `GET /api/friends/active` — friends' active sessions, respects `share_to_feed` + `share_live` prefs
- ✅ S22-005: `components/social/DrinkingNow.tsx` — horizontal scroll strip in HomeFeed, pulse ring avatars, 60s polling
- ✅ S22-006: "Friends Here Now" section on brewery detail page
- ✅ S22-007: Session start notifications — in-app + push to friends when session starts
- ✅ S22-008: "Show Active Sessions" privacy toggle in Settings → Privacy (`share_live` pref)
- ✅ S22-009: Logo bug fix — inline styles replace presentation attrs, `auto` theme with CSS vars, size bumps, wider mark↔wordmark gap

**Key architectural changes from Sprint 22:**
- `HopMark.tsx` — all SVG colors use `style={{ fill/stroke }}` inline styles (not presentation attributes) to win CSS cascade
- `auto` theme: `var(--accent-gold)` / `var(--text-primary)` — adapts to dark↔cream toggle; use on theme-toggling surfaces
- Horizontal lockup viewBox `352×72`, text x=72 for mark↔wordmark breathing room
- `HopMarkIcon` export for favicon/manifest canvas generation
- `HOPMARK_PATHS` export — raw SVG path data for canvas/export
- `/api/friends/active` — fire-and-forget pattern; no migration needed (share_live is JSONB key, defaults true when absent)
- `DrinkingNow` polls every 60s (not Realtime) — upgrade if engagement warrants
- Session start calls `notifyFriendsSessionStarted()` with `.catch(() => {})` (non-blocking)
- AppNav: `theme="auto"` height=32, BreweryAdminNav: `theme="auto"` height=24
- Auth layout: desktop height=30, mobile height=32 (stays `theme="cream"` — hardcoded bg)

**Deferred to Sprint 23:**
- S21-001: Playwright E2E (7th carry — Casey's sit-in continues)
- Alex: draw animation on auth logo (SVG path animation)
- Supabase Realtime upgrade for Friends Live (if engagement data supports it)
- Riley: Migration consolidation proposal (028+029)
- Taylor: Close first paid brewery

### Sprint 23 — Bug Bash ✅ (2026-03-28)
**Theme:** Full team audit + systematic bug fixes across all surfaces
**Audit team:** Morgan (coordinator), Alex (UI/UX), Jordan (core features), Sam+Casey (QA), Drew+Riley (infra), Jamie+Taylor (brand/sales)

- ✅ S23-001: BreweryAdminNav HopMark — bumped to 32px, removed opacity-60, standardized padding to px-6
- ✅ S23-002: The Board audit — code verified correct (isBoard strips nav, data flow complete, Realtime working)
- ✅ S23-003: Brewery reviews — `brewery_reviews` table (migration 031), API routes (GET/POST/DELETE), `BreweryReview` component on brewery detail page
- ✅ S23-004: Avatars storage bucket — migration 030 creates `avatars` bucket + RLS policies (fixes silent profile photo upload failures)
- ✅ S23-005: Hardcoded `#D4A843` sweep — replaced across 12+ files with `var(--accent-gold)` using `color-mix()` for alpha variants
- ✅ S23-006: API error handling — added to `/api/notifications`, `/api/push/subscribe`, `/api/pint-rewind`, `/api/friends/active`
- ✅ S23-007: Missing loading.tsx — added for `brewery-welcome/[id]`

- ✅ S23-011: AppNav accessibility — `aria-label` on mobile nav links + FAB, `aria-hidden` on decorative icons
- ✅ S23-012: Auth layout logo sizes — standardized desktop to 32px (was 30px, mobile was already 32px)
- ✅ S23-013: DarkCardWrapper — replaced redundant hardcoded colors with refs to `DARK_VARS` object
- ✅ S23-014: Profile banner gradient — replaced hardcoded `#0F0E0C` gradient with `var(--bg)` + `color-mix()` for theme toggle support

**Key architectural changes from Sprint 23:**
- `brewery_reviews` table with unique(user_id, brewery_id) constraint — one review per user per brewery
- `/api/brewery/[brewery_id]/reviews` — GET (list + avg), POST (upsert), DELETE
- `BreweryReview` component at `components/brewery/BreweryReview.tsx` — star picker, inline form, review list, delete confirmation
- `avatars` storage bucket with RLS (user-scoped upload/update/delete, public read)
- `color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent-gold) N%, transparent)` pattern replaces `rgba(212,168,67,N)` throughout
- All focus states now use `focus:border-[var(--accent-gold)]` instead of hardcoded `#D4A843`
- Migrations 030, 031 added (apply with `supabase db push`)

**Deferred to Sprint 24:**
- S21-001: Playwright E2E (8th carry — Casey's sit-in escalates)
- Alex: draw animation on auth logo (SVG path animation)
- Supabase Realtime upgrade for Friends Live
- Riley: Migration consolidation proposal (028+029)
- Taylor: Close first paid brewery

### Sprint 24 — Avatar Fix + Stability (2026-03-28)
**Theme:** Fix children photos, investigate full-page error, stability polish

- ✅ S24-001: Avatar seed photo fix — replaced men/22→47, women/28→53, women/17→62, men/11→58 to avoid young-looking portraits
  - Seeds updated: `supabase/seeds/005_user_avatars.sql`
  - Re-run seed 005 against remote DB to apply

**Known open issues carried into Sprint 24:**
- "Something is wrong error on every page" — Joshua reported full-page error boundary triggering; dev server returns correct HTTP codes, root cause not yet identified (check Sentry, browser console, auth state)
- Re-run seed 005 against remote database after fixing portrait numbers
- Apply seeds after any DB reset

### Sprint 25 — Rate & Relate ✅ (2026-03-28)
**Theme:** Fix the rating system, redesign session recap, overhaul the feed
**Plan:** `docs/sprint-25-plan.md`

- ✅ S25-001: StarRating bug fix — `flex` → `inline-flex` prevents 5th star clipping, all hardcoded colors replaced with CSS vars
- ✅ S25-002: Migration 032 — `beer_reviews` table (dedicated beer reviews, mirrors brewery_reviews pattern)
- ✅ S25-003: `BreweryRatingHeader` component — prominent rating display at top of brewery page (after hero), inline star picker with progressive comment disclosure
- ✅ S25-004: Beer reviews API — `GET/POST/DELETE /api/beer/[beer_id]/reviews` (upsert pattern, public read, auth write own)
- ✅ S25-005: Beer log PATCH API — `PATCH /api/sessions/[id]/beers/[logId]` for updating ratings from recap screen
- ✅ S25-006: Session recap v2 — split beers into "Rate These?" (unrated, inline star pickers) + "Already Rated" (compact), brewery quick review section, compact hero, max-w-lg centered
- ✅ S25-007: Feed card visual refresh — killed redundant brewery banner, brewery name as `font-display` headline, readable beer list (one per line with style tag + rating), session photo support, session note display (blockquote)
- ✅ S25-008: Welcome card slim-down — full card on first visit of day (localStorage timestamp), slim single-line bar on subsequent visits; removed weekly stats from feed
- ✅ S25-009: Filter tab redesign — full-width tab bar with counts (`All 24 · Friends 18 · You 6`), equal-width buttons
- ✅ S25-010: `BeerReviewSection` component on beer page — dedicated reviews from `beer_reviews` table, existing beer_logs section renamed to "Activity"
- ✅ S25-011: SessionComments redesign — last 2 comments always visible as preview, comment input always visible (not hidden behind expand), expand/collapse for full thread

**Key architectural changes from Sprint 25:**
- Migration 032 applied to remote
- `beer_reviews` table — public read, auth write own, UNIQUE(user_id, beer_id)
- `BreweryRatingHeader` at `components/brewery/BreweryRatingHeader.tsx` — inline rating + CTA at top of brewery page
- `BeerReviewSection` at `components/beer/BeerReviewSection.tsx` — star picker, comment, review list
- `/api/beer/[beer_id]/reviews/route.ts` — GET (list + avg + user review), POST (upsert), DELETE
- `/api/sessions/[id]/beers/[logId]/route.ts` — PATCH (update rating)
- `StarRating` component: `inline-flex` container, CSS var colors throughout

- `HomeFeed` welcome card: first-visit-of-day detection via localStorage, slim bar variant
- `SessionComments`: eager fetch, 2-comment preview always visible, input always visible
- Feed filter tabs: full-width bar with counts per filter

**Deferred to Sprint 26:**
- Cheers/reaction button on feed cards (P1)
- Feed infinite scroll / pagination (P2)
- Backfill beer_reviews from beer_logs (decided against — separate signals)
- `beers.avg_rating` migration to pull from `beer_reviews` instead of `beer_logs`

**Backlogged (no sprint):**
- Playwright E2E — Casey, someday. We believe in you.

### Sprint 26 — The Glow-Up ✅ (2026-03-28)
**Theme:** Recap redesign, feed friends-first, brewery admin 404 fix

- ✅ SessionComments redesign — always-visible input, 2-comment preview
- ✅ Brewery admin 404 fix

### Sprint 27 — Three-Tab Feed ✅ (2026-03-28)
**Theme:** Friends / Discover / You — full three-tab feed redesign per Morgan's brief
**Retro:** `docs/retros/sprint-27-retro.md`

- ✅ Complete `HomeFeed.tsx` rewrite — three-tab architecture (Friends/Discover/You)
- ✅ `FeedTabBar` — spring-animated layoutId underline indicator
- ✅ `AchievementFeedCard` — gold gradient, tier pills (bronze/silver/gold/platinum), XP badge
- ✅ `StreakFeedCard` — milestone detection (3/5/7/14/21/30/50/100), localStorage dedup
- ✅ `DrinkingNow` updated — all green → `var(--accent-gold)`, renamed "Live Now"
- ✅ You tab: profile hero + XP bar, 4-stat grid, Taste DNA animated bars, Recent Achievements, Want-to-Try wishlist, Brewery Passport
- ✅ Discover tab: BOTW, Trending, Events, New Breweries 2-col grid
- ✅ Seed 009 — 24 sessions, 65+ beer logs, 14 beer reviews, 8 brewery reviews, 2 active sessions
- ✅ Seed 010 — friend achievements, streak milestones, refreshed active sessions, extra reviews
- ✅ **Migration 033 — CRITICAL BUG FIX:** `sessions.brewery_id` and `beer_logs.brewery_id` changed from `text` → `uuid` with FK to `breweries`. Root cause of empty friends feed since Sprint 13.

**Key architectural changes from Sprint 27:**
- `FeedTabBar` at `components/social/FeedTabBar.tsx` — type `FeedTab = "friends" | "discover" | "you"`
- `AchievementFeedCard` at `components/social/AchievementFeedCard.tsx`
- `StreakFeedCard` at `components/social/StreakFeedCard.tsx` — exports `isStreakMilestone`, `isStreakSeen`, `markStreakSeen`
- `HomeFeed.tsx` props: `activeFriendSessions`, `friendAchievements`, `userAchievements`, `wishlist`, `styleDNA`, `friendCount`
- Taste DNA computed server-side in `page.tsx` from `beer_logs` join `beers(style)` — grouped/averaged per style
- `visitedBreweries` for Brewery Passport derived client-side via `useMemo` from `youSessions` — zero extra queries
- Migration 033: stale sessions with invalid brewery_ids were nulled (not deleted)
- After migration 033: run `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';` in Supabase SQL editor to flush PostgREST schema cache
- Service worker (`public/sw.js`) caches static routes — unregister via DevTools → Application → Service Workers after dev server restarts

**Deferred to Sprint 28:**
- Verify full feed render with all card types (requires PGRST schema reload + SW unregister + hard reload)
- Cheers/reaction button on feed cards (P1 — carried from Sprint 25)
- Feed infinite scroll / pagination (P2 — carried from Sprint 25)
- E2E tests (Casey, still waiting, still watching)

### Sprint 28 — Feed Spec Implementation ✅ (2026-03-29)
**Theme:** Close the gap between Morgan's feed spec and what shipped
**Spec:** `docs/HopTrack-Feed-Implementation-Spec.docx` (Morgan)

- ✅ S28-006: `TrendingCard` redesigned — vertical list → horizontal scroll of compact beer cards with style badges + star ratings
- ✅ S28-007: BOTW compact banner on Friends tab (gold gradient strip, above feed)
- ✅ S28-008: Scroll position memory between tabs (`useRef` + `requestAnimationFrame`)
- ✅ S28-009: New data queries — friend 5-star reviews (new_favorite), recent friendships (friend_joined)
- ✅ S28-010: Editorial mock data — 4 seasonal beers, 3 curated collections (Jamie owns editorial)
- ✅ S28-011: Hydration fix — `SessionRecapSheet` dynamic import (`ssr: false`) to break Turbopack module chain
- ✅ S28-012: `hasCommunityContent` updated to include seasonal/curated data

**Key architectural changes from Sprint 28:**
- `RecommendationCard` at `components/social/RecommendationCard.tsx`
- `NewFavoriteCard` at `components/social/NewFavoriteCard.tsx`
- `FriendJoinedCard` at `components/social/FriendJoinedCard.tsx`
- `SeasonalBeersScroll` + `CuratedCollectionsList` added to `components/social/DiscoveryCard.tsx`
- `FeedItem` union type extended: `new_favorite`, `friend_joined`
- `HomeFeedProps` extended: `newFavorites`, `friendsJoined`
- `SessionRecapSheet` loaded via `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false` (fixes Turbopack cache corruption)
- `confetti` import changed to dynamic `import()` call
- Discover tab: 6 sections total (BOTW, Trending, Events, Seasonal & Limited, Curated Collections, New Breweries)
- No new migrations — editorial data is hardcoded, new card types use existing tables

**Deferred to Sprint 29:**
- Cheers/reaction button on feed cards (P1 — carried from Sprint 25)
- Feed infinite scroll / pagination (P2 — carried from Sprint 25)
- PGRST schema cache refresh (`NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';`) to restore session data in feed
- E2E tests (Casey, eternal vigil)

### Revenue Targets
- Tap tier: $49/mo
- Cask tier: $149/mo
- Barrel tier: custom
- First paid brewery: Sprint 16 hard deadline (Taylor) — close or reassess GTM
- 500 paid breweries: 6 months post-launch ($75K MRR)

### Team Expansion Plan (discussed 2026-03-26)
1. 🥇 Customer Success / Onboarding — hire when first brewery closes
2. 🥈 Growth / SEO Lead — hire before 500 brewery push
3. 🥉 Analytics Engineer — hire at ~20-50 active breweries
